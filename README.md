# Visual Pocket
- Experimental Code-Editor snapshot for future interactive portfolio viewing


## Requirements of Visual Pocket
- For an individual to interact fully with an executable build
- To link a repository's build to a code editor and correctly build the project externally
- To be able to clearly and visually showcase aspects of a project concisely.
- For a user to be able to submit feedback and thoughts of a particular visual pocket (as an email, blog, CRM platform, etc...)


## MVP Implementations
- LHS can contain code but RHS can contain a small video recording of a particular application. This abstracts away complexities around hosting static builds of older applications. 
- Platform for form submissions of feedback received.
- API for linking other GitHub projects to application.
